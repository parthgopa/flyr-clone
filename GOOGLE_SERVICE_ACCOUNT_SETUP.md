### **Step 6: Place JSON File in Backend**

1. **Rename the downloaded JSON file** to something simple:
   ```
   flyr-service-account.json
   ```

2. **Place it in your backend directory:**
   ```
   backend/
   ├── flyr-service-account.json  ← HERE
   ├── app.py
   ├── routes/
   └── models/
   ```

3. **⚠️ SECURITY: Add to .gitignore**
   - Open `backend/.gitignore`
   - Add this line:
   ```
   *.json
   flyr-service-account.json
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Configure Backend Environment Variables**

1. **Open or create:** `backend/.env`

2. **Add these environment variables:**

```env
# Google Play IAP Configuration
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=c:\Users\Harsh\Downloads\flyr-service-account.json
ANDROID_PACKAGE_NAME=com.anonymous.flyrclone

# MongoDB (if not already set)
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/flyr_db

# Other existing variables...
```

3. **Save the file**

---

### **Step 8: Install Required Python Packages**

Make sure these are in `backend/requirements.txt`:

```txt
google-api-python-client
google-auth
```

Install them:

```bash
cd backend
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth
```

---

## 🧪 Test Backend Configuration

### **Test 1: Check if JSON file is accessible**

Create a test script: `backend/test_google_api.py`

```python
import os
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build

# Test configuration
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "flyr-service-account.json"
PACKAGE_NAME = "com.anonymous.flyrclone"

def test_google_api_connection():
    """Test if Google Play API is accessible"""
    try:
        print("🔍 Testing Google Play API connection...")
        print(f"📁 Service account file: {GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS}")
        print(f"📦 Package name: {PACKAGE_NAME}")
        
        # Check if file exists
        if not os.path.exists(GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS):
            print("❌ Service account JSON file not found!")
            return False
        
        print("✅ Service account JSON file found")
        
        # Load credentials
        credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(
            GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS,
            scopes=['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/androidpublisher']
        )
        print("✅ Credentials loaded successfully")
        
        # Build API client
        service = build('androidpublisher', 'v3', credentials=credentials)
        print("✅ Google Play API client built successfully")
        
        # Try to access app details (this will fail if permissions are wrong)
        try:
            # This endpoint requires proper permissions
            result = service.edits().insert(
                packageName=PACKAGE_NAME,
                body={}
            ).execute()
            edit_id = result['id']
            
            # Delete the test edit
            service.edits().delete(
                packageName=PACKAGE_NAME,
                editId=edit_id
            ).execute()
            
            print("✅ API permissions verified - can access app data")
            print("\n🎉 SUCCESS! Backend is properly configured!")
            return True
            
        except Exception as e:
            error_msg = str(e)
            if "403" in error_msg:
                print("⚠️  API access works but permissions may need adjustment")
                print("   Make sure service account has proper permissions in Play Console")
            else:
                print(f"⚠️  API test failed: {error_msg}")
            return True  # Connection works, just permissions issue
            
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Configuration error: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_google_api_connection()
```

**Run the test:**

```bash
cd backend
python test_google_api.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔍 Testing Google Play API connection...
📁 Service account file: flyr-service-account.json
📦 Package name: com.anonymous.flyrclone
✅ Service account JSON file found
✅ Credentials loaded successfully
✅ Google Play API client built successfully
✅ API permissions verified - can access app data

🎉 SUCCESS! Backend is properly configured!
```

### **Test 2: Test Purchase Verification Endpoint**

Once your backend is running, test the purchase verification:

```bash
# Start your Flask backend
cd backend
python app.py
```

**Test with curl (in another terminal):**

```bash
# Test if products endpoint works (no auth needed)
curl http://localhost:5000/purchase/products
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "products": [
    {"id": "image_pack_10", "credits": 10, "price": 100, ...},
    ...
  ],
  "cost_per_image": 10
}
```
